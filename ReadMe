Personal Security Dashboard
A web-based security tool built with Python and Flask that analyzes password strength and checks credentials against known data breach databases — privately and securely.
Live demo: (add your link here after deploying)
Built by: Kedar Rohan Nalawade

What It Does

Password Strength Analysis — scores passwords across 6 security criteria including length, character variety, and common password detection
Data Breach Check — queries the HaveIBeenPwned database to check if a password has appeared in any known breach (over 800 million compromised passwords)
Security Recommendations — generates tailored advice based on weaknesses found
Privacy-first design — your password is never transmitted. Uses the k-anonymity model (only a partial SHA-1 hash prefix is sent to the API)

How the Breach Check Works (K-Anonymity)
This project uses a privacy-preserving technique called k-anonymity to check passwords against breach databases without exposing the actual password:

The password is hashed locally using SHA-1
Only the first 5 characters of that hash are sent to the HaveIBeenPwned API
The API returns all hash suffixes that match that prefix (hundreds of results)
The full hash is matched locally — the real password never leaves your machine

This is the same method used by major browsers and password managers like 1Password.

What I Learned

How password entropy works and what makes credentials resistant to brute-force attacks
The k-anonymity privacy model and why it matters in security tooling
How to build and consume RESTful APIs securely in Python
Flask routing, JSON handling, and serving static assets
Why credential stuffing is dangerous and how breach databases help defend against it


Future Improvements

 Add email breach checking (requires HaveIBeenPwned API key)
 Generate a downloadable security report (PDF)
 Add a password generator tool
 Deploy to cloud (Render / Railway) for public access
 Add rate limiting to the API endpoint
